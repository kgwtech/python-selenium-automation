        <p>Beshbarmak recipe is a traditional Kazakhstan meal of meat and noodles. A layer of cooked
            <br>
            noodles is topped with perfectly tender meat and a flavorful onion broth. Traditionally this meal was made
            with
            <br>
            horse meat and eaten with your hands but today’s more modern version of Beshbarmak recipe is much easier to
            make and enjoy.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            My recipe calls for lamb, made tender in an instant pot or on the stove-top, and uses
            <br>
            oven-ready lasagna noodles
            to cut down on prep time. These simple shortcuts make this meal perfect for a unique and exciting dinner.

        <u><h2>Recipe Origin</h2></u>

        <div>
            <p align="center">The name Beshbarmak (and other similar names like Besbarmak) translates to mean “five
                fingers”,
                which is how this dish was originally eaten. Nomadic tribes would use their bare hands to enjoy
                the traditional Kazakh dish, along with a soup or broth called chyk, shurpo or shorpa on the side.
                These nomadic lifestyles relied heavily on animals, their milk products, and meat for nourishment.
                They would make Beshbarmak dish out of horse meat, camel, or mutton or even a mixture of all three.
                Occasionally beef could be used.
                <br>
                <br>
                Because the dish was enjoyed by nomadic peoples, variations can be found all over Central Asian cuisine.
                It is considered the national dish of Kazakhstan and a big part of Kazakh hospitality. The serving
                of Beshbarmak was very ritualistic. It was often prepared for special occasions when the guest of honor
                would be allowed to choose an animal from the herd for the meal. The entire sheep was cooked, including
                the head, which was slowly boiled until tender and became the focal point of the traditional dish.
                <br>
                <br>
                Beshbarmak recipe was served in large communal serving dishes that everyone would sit around on the
                floor or low table. Pieces of the head would be cut by the most respected member of the table.
                Different meats were served to different guests and family members, depending on their age, gender, and
                social rank. The best pieces of meat went to the oldest adult men, then the men, then women, younger
                adults, and finally the children, meant to encourage them to work hard to earn their status.
                <br>
                <br>
                Today the meal is served in a more modern way, letting go of traditions. It is still served at special
                occasions but is also enjoyed in homes of Kazakh people on an average weeknight as well.
                Horse meat is rarely used outside of Kazakhstan as it is illegal in many countries. Lamb is a perfectly
                authentic replacement.
                Classic Beshbarmak is also rarely eaten with your hands or served dependent on social structure–but you
                could always give it a try!

                        <strong>Easy Prep:</strong>
                        This very traditional meal is made much easier with the use of an Instant Pot and
                        premade noodles.

                        <strong>Simple Ingredients:</strong>
                        This recipe calls for very few ingredients, but you can add extra vegetables
                        to make it even more filling.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Traditional Flavor:</strong>
                        Kazakhstan doesn’t have many dishes of its own as Kazakh cuisine is heavily
                        influenced by neighboring countries. <br> Beshbarmak is one meal the country is known for! It’s
                        the
                        most popular dish in the country.

            <tr>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Lamb Shoulder:</strong> Lamb is the most authentic choice, but you could also use beef.
                        Any cut of beef
                        will work. If you can get your hands <br> on it and are feeling adventurous, horse meat is the
                        truly
                        authentic ingredient in this dish!
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Yellow Onions:</strong> Yellow onions provide the best flavor for this recipe without
                        being overwhelming.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Lasagna Noodles:</strong> I used oven-ready noodles, but you could also use regular
                        lasagna noodles. Most
                        recipes for this meal call for <br> making your pasta from scratch. You can certainly do this
                        instead! <a href="https://foreignfork.com/how-to-make-homemade-pasta/">Check out this article

                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Herbs:</strong> Fresh dill, bay leaves</li>
                    <li><strong>Parsley, Dill, and Scallion for Topping:</strong> These are all optional, but I used all
                        three :)

        <table>
            <ol>
                <li>Place the lamb in an instant pot and fill the pot the rest of the way with water (about 12 cups in a
                    6-quart pot. If you can fit 16 cups in your 8-quart pot, that is even better!).

                    Place the lid on the pot and cook on HIGH for 30 minutes, ending with an Instant Pressure release.
                    If you are cooking the lamb on the stove-top, cook the lamb in a large pot with 16 cups of water on
                    low heat. Cook with the lid on for about an hour and a half, until it is fall-off-the-bone tender.
                    When the lamb is done cooking, remove it from the liquid and set the remaining broth aside. Remove
                    the lamb from the bone, cut into small pieces and set the meat aside.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Pour the reserved broth into a large pot and bring it to a boil. Once boiling, add the large onion
                    rings into the broth and allow them to cook until soft (about 15 minutes). Remove from the broth and
                    set aside.

                    Salt the broth lightly (remember you will still be eating it, so do not over-salt!). Then add the
                    lasagna noodles into the boiling water and cook until soft. Remove from the broth.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Run the pasta underwater until it cools. Then cut the lasagna noodles into thirds to make smaller
                    squares. Set aside. Run the pasta underwater until it cools. Then cut the lasagna noodles into
                    thirds to make smaller squares. Set aside.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li>Finally, make the chyk sauce. To do so, place the reserved two cups of broth in a smaller pot. Add
                    the third chopped onion, bay leaf, salt, and pepper to taste. Bring this to a boil until the onions
                    are tender, about 5-8 minutes.

                    Time to serve! To prepare your platter, pile the pasta squares in a thin layer onto a large platter.
                    Then add the cooked onions on top of the pasta, then the lamb meat on top of the onions. Pour your
                    chyk sauce (the 2 cups of broth) over the platter. Sprinkle with parsley, chives, and dill if
                    desired.

                    Divide the larger portion of broth into four serving bowls. Sprinkle each serving bowl with fresh
                    dill. The platter goes in the center of the table and each person gets their own bowl of broth!
